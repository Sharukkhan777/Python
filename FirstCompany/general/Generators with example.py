'''
Generators :
    * Definition:
        A generator-function is defined like a normal function, but whenever it needs to generate a value, 
        it does so with the yield keyword rather than return. 
        If the body of a def contains yield, the function automatically becomes a generator function.
        
    * A generator function is defined like a normal function, but whenever it needs to generate a value, it does so with the yield keyword rather than return.
    * We should use yield when we want to iterate over a sequence, but donâ€™t want to store the entire sequence in memory.
    * Return sends a specified value back to its caller whereas Yield can produce a sequence of values.

# Example code with yield keyword
 
# A Python program to generate squares from 1 
# to 100 using yield and therefore generator 

# An infinite generator function that prints 
# next square number. It starts with 1 
def nextSquare(): 
	i = 1; 

	# An Infinite loop to generate squares 
	while True: 
		yield i*i	#!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Warning, if we use return here we get error			 
		i += 1 # Next execution resumes 
				# from this point	 

# Driver code to test above generator 
# function 
for num in nextSquare(): 
	if num > 100: 
		break	
	print(num)
