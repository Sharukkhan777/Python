# Simple Terms

* First, We can find this in the assumptions of Regression.
* In the Regression Equation,
    y = mx + b + ε (error term, epsilon)
* If we Scatter plot x and ε(error).
    If we find any correlation, whether it is positive or negative,
    The Linear Regression will be biased one.
    
####  With Example ####
* Suppose y is Ice-Cream Sales
          x is Temperature
          ε is error term
* Generally we know y and x is positively correlated.
* But if we Scatter plot Ice-Cream Sales and ε(error).
    If we find any correlation, whether it is positive or negative,
    The Linear Regression will be biased one.
