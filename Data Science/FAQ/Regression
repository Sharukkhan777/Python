1. What if 4 variables out of 9 variables is linear relationship, Can we use Linear regression?
    -> First how to find linear relationship?
          Simple Scatter plot to X1,y   X2,y   X3,y    Xn,y , 
          We can see some linear relationship by those scatter plot,
    -> In Real time data,
          We never use one model to fit,
          We use linear, polynomial, random forest and so on
          So we see accuracy of each model and -select- which has good accuracy
    -> Flagging
          So the question is Can we use Linear Regression or not
          Simply Out of 9 variables, if we have 5 or more varibles
          has linear relationship(high majority)
          Then we can use linear regression.
